For the people who are new to the field or otherwise feel inadequate...


The average developer:

- does not use Rust.
- does not use Neovim.
- does not write insightful blog posts.
- does not have followers.
- does not maintain a popular open source project.
- does not maintain ANY open source project.
- is not an ex-FANG employee.
- is more than the code they write.

Unrealistic expectations can be about things other than body image issues. Just like in Instagram, on YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News and the rest, you only see the idealized version of people and their ideas.
